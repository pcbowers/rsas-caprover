## Repo for CapRover RSAS One Click App

This repository is a fork of caprover/one-click-apps.

If you add `https://pcbowers.github.io/rsas-caprover` to your 3rd party repositories listed at the bottom of the `One Click Apps`, you can add this one click application. It makes building an IceCast Server with CapRover extremely simple, allowing you to specify the username and password to connect to, a mount to access the radio server, and a port that will accept your broadcaster connections.
